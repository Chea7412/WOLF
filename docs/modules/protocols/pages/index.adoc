There are 6 main protocols involved in the current Moonlight protocol:

* HTTP (TCP 47989)
** unencrypted 🔓
** used to exchanged public information needed to start xref:http-pairing.adoc[pairing clients]
* HTTPS (TCP 47984)
** encrypted 🔐 (SSL)
** only available to paired clients
** used to exchange available apps, encryption keys and trigger the start of a stream
* xref:rtsp.adoc[RTSP] (TCP 48010)
** unencrypted 🔓
** Used to exchange ports and settings for the next 3 streams
* xref:control-specs.adoc[Control over ENet] (UDP 47999)
** encrypted 🔐 (using AES GCM 128 bit)
** Used to exchange user input data and extra stream information
* xref:rtp-video.adoc[Video over RTP] (UDP 47998)
** unencrypted 🔓
** Uses H.264 or HEVC to encode video
* xref:rtp-opus.adoc[Audio over RTP] (UDP 48000)
** encrypted 🔐 (using AES CBC 128 bit)
** Uses Opus to encode audio

[NOTE]
====
The ports specified here are the defaults, apart from HTTP/S all other ports can be dynamically set by the backend and will be correctly picked up by the Moonlight client.
