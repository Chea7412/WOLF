= Overview

Wolf is an open source streaming server for https://moonlight-stream.org/[Moonlight] that allows you to share a single server with multiple remote clients in order to stream video and audio with low latency +

== How it works

Wolf runs as a Docker container that will start and stop automatically new containers on-demand.
This has a few major advantages:

* Each remote client will run in a separate and isolated container.
* Input devices (mouse, keyboard, joypads) are completely isolated between multiple users.
* Nothing is permanently installed on the host; wiping down the Docker images and the permanent storage folder is all you need to completely clean your server.

If you are curious to look under the hood of Wolf we have some high-level docs under the _Developer guide,_ and you can always take a look at the actual code since everything is open source.
