== Overview

Here we start with a question:
[NOTE.think,caption=⁇]

====
How can we securely authenticate an untrusted client over an insecure network?
====

This involves quite a bit of cryptography and a few steps between the client (Moonlight) and the server (Wolf).

    W->W: get PIN from user

    W->W: decrypt client challenge
    W->W: generate server challenge
    W->>-M: server challenge 🔐

    Note over M,W: Phase 3
    M->>+W: server challenge response 🔐
    W->>-M: server secret + signature

    Note over M,W: Phase 4
    M->>+W: client secret + signature
    W->W: check client signature
    W->>-M: paired = 1

    Note over M,W: Phase 5 (over HTTPS)
    M->>+W: pairchallenge
    W->>-M: paired = 1
....

== Phase 1

    autonumber
    participant M as Moonlight
    participant W as Wolf

    M->>+W:salt + client cert
    W->W: get PIN from user
    W->W: AES KEY = SHA256(SALT + PIN)
    W->>-M:server cert
....

Moonlight will send a salt and client certificate, users will see a prompt asking to insert the password on the remote server.
On the backend, we'll need the PIN to be inserted by the user.

PIN and SALT will be used to derive a shared AES key that needs to be stored in order to be used to decrypt in the next phases.

At this stage we only have to send back our public certificate (`plaincert`).

== Phase 2

    autonumber
    participant M as Moonlight
    participant W as Wolf

    M->>+W: client challenge 🔐
    W->W: decrypt client challenge
    W->W: generate server challenge
    W->>-M: server challenge 🔐
....

Using the AES key that we generated in the phase 1 we have to decrypt the client challenge,

We generate a SHA256 hash with the following:

* Decrypted challenge
* Server certificate signature
* Server secret: a randomly generated secret

The hash + server_challenge will then be AES encrypted and sent as the `challengeresponse`

== Phase 3

[mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant M as Moonlight
    participant W as Wolf

    M->>+W: server challenge response 🔐
    W->>-M: server secret + signature
....

Moonlight will send back a `serverchallengeresp`: an AES encrypted client hash, we have to send back the `pairingsecret`:
using our private key we have to sign the certificate_signature + server_secret (generated in phase 2)

== Phase 4

[mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant M as Moonlight
    participant W as Wolf

    M->>+W: client secret + signature
    W->W: check client signature
    W->>-M: paired = 1
....

We now have to use everything we exchanged before in order to verify and finally pair the clients.

We'll check the client_hash obtained at phase 3, it should contain the following:

* The original server_challenge
* The signature of the X509 client_cert
* The unencrypted `client_pairing_secret`

We'll check that `SHA256(server_challenge + client_public_cert_signature + client_secret) == client_hash`

Then using the client certificate public key we should be able to verify that the client secret has been signed by Moonlight

The response will contain:

* paired = 1, if all checks are fine
* paired = 0, otherwise

== Phase 5 (HTTPS)

    autonumber
    participant M as Moonlight
    participant W as Wolf

    M->>+W:salt
    M->>+W: pairchallenge
    W->>-M: paired = 1
....

This extra step will run over HTTPS in order to make sure that Moonlight can reach Wolf over a secure connection.
